          <p class="title" style="margin-top: 50px;">My experience</p>

          <p><i>Overview.</i></p>
          <p>The summer of 2019 was 20 weeks worth of things to do packed into 10 - My project with the G Suite
            team, participating in design sprints, winning a post it art contest B), learning from other brilliant
            designers
            and researchers and from my fellow interns! But every bit of those busy ten weeks have been extremely
            rewarding.
            What follows are parts of the experience that really stood out.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 50px;"> <i>Multidisciplinary exposure.</i></p>
          <p> A lot of my college projects have looked like this: A design student,
            working under the guidance of a design professor and also taking regular feedback from design student
            classmates
            and seniors. We do manage to get feedback from field experts and users when required, but their involvement
            remains minimal and given the constraints of the academic setup, they are not heavily invested. However,
            through
            the projects that I worked on at Google, I got a chance to collaborate not just with designers but with
            product
            managers and engineers across different teams. Each of them had a different and valuable viewpoint of
            looking at
            the product — discussions with them made me more sensitive to their point of view to eventually make a
            better
            end product.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 50px;"> <i>Primary project.</i></p>
          <p>
            I designed a feature for the Admin Console of G Suite pose studying
            existing user journeys and identifying gaps. The Admin Console is a large product, and I collaborated with
            the 8
            sub-teams that own parts of it to create my final mocks. After multiple iterations, user feedback was taken
            on
            the
            mocks and a future scope was established. I also got a chance to participate in initial discussions about
            the
            development of the feature, which was a fitting end to the internship :)
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 50px;"> <i>Secondary project.</i></p>

          <p>I contributed in a design sprint to help ideate product directions for an upcoming app with a team which
            included
            designers, engineers, product managers, engineers and members of the marketing team. Through the sprint, I
            got a
            chance to lead ideations with groups of users, conduct one on one interviews and ideate flows that were
            tested
            with users.

          <p>The people. The environment at Google had made the option of borrowing a colleague’s time was only an email
            away.
            They were happy to answer questions related to their project, their careers or the design industry in
            general.
            This made the place a lot more welcoming and made it easy to get imbibed in the culture and grow as a
            designer.

          <p>The internship was an amazing experience where I got to learn a lot from the work and the people. The
            project
            helped me understand the parts of the design process that I need to work on more. I think my main takeaways
            from
            the internship was learning how to document, communicate and collaborate effectively!</p>
