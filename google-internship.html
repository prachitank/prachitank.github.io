  <h1>10 weeks at Google!</h1>
  <p> An overview. The summer of 2019 was 20 weeks worth of things to do packed into 10 - My project with the G Suite team, participating in design sprints, winning a post it art contest B), learning from other brilliant designers and researchers and from my fellow interns! But every bit of those busy ten weeks have been extremely rewarding. What follows are parts of the experience that really stood out.</p>

  <p> <i>The multidisciplinary exposure.</i> A lot of my college projects have looked like this: A design student, working under the guidance of a design professor and also taking regular feedback from design student classmates and seniors. We do manage to get feedback from field experts and users when required, but their involvement remains minimal and given the constraints of the academic setup, they are not heavily invested. However, through the projects that I worked on at Google, I got a chance to collaborate not just with designers but with product managers and engineers across different teams. Each of them had a different and valuable viewpoint of looking at the product â€” discussions with them made me more sensitive to their point of view to eventually make a better end product.</p>
