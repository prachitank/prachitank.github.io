      <p> I have a bachelor's degree in fashion communication from the national institute of fashion technology. and am currently pursuing my master's in interaction design from the Industrial Design Centre at IDC.

      My enthusiasm for creating better communication solutions brought me to Interaction Design. With a data driven approach, I want to make sure that the people I design for are at the forefront.
