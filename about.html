  <p class="greeting">FAQ </p>

  <p>What am I doing right now?</p>

  <p class="running-text"> Currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Interaction Design from the Industrial Design Centre (IDC) at IIT Bombay. </p>

  <p>What have I done before?</p>
  
  <p class="running-text">I have a Bachelor's Degree in Fashion Communication from NIFT (National Institute of Fashion Technology), Hyderabad. </p>

  <p class="running-text">
  I have also interned at Beard Design (UI/UX Team) & Ogilvy One (Creative & Planning Team). </p>
  
  <p>Why did I steer towards UX Design from Communication Design?</p>

  <p class="running-text">An enthusiasm for solving problems brought me to Interaction Design. With a data-centric approach, I aim to make sure that the users are at the forefront for my design.</p>

  <p>What do I do for fun?</p>

  <p class="running-text"> I like to read and am trying to explore different genres and authors. However, I tend to gravitate towards novels which can be summed up into 'What to do if the FBI, CIA and Interpol are after you?'. I try learning new things be it languages - Korean being my current obsession, coding, history lessons or listening to an interesting podcast. I binge on TV shows, to the point that it is borderline unhealthy but I like to think that I make up for it by playing badminton or just going for a run!</p>

<!--   <p>Website related things</p>
  <p class="running-text"> In case you were wondering why the full stop next to my name that keeps changing different colors. It is my attbpt to make the website reflect me. That might not make a lot of sense. So let me explain - right now the dot is changing colors 70 times per minute which also happens to be my resting heart rate. And when I have the surplus to invest in smart watch or a fit bit, I plan to connect it to the website so this becomes a 'live' website. Yes, it might be nothing more than a gimmick, but I think it be hella cool.</p>

  <p>How does one recognise me in a crowd?</p> 
  <p class="running-text"> Hands always making the peace sign. Jumping around if there is Vada Pav in the mess that day.</p>
